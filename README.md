_This is the home of the command-line tool, [bx](https://github.com/OpenOmics/nih-box). Its long-term goals: to enable [FAIR<sup>1</sup>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792175/) scientific research, to archive and share project data, and to create a unified tool that makes using Box easier than ever before!_

## Overview
Welcome to bx! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [bx's documentation](https://openomics.github.io/nih-box/).

The **`./bx`** command-line tool is composed several inter-related sub commands to explore and archive data across the NIH's Box storage system. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>bx <b>ls</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nih-box/usage/ls/): List Box directory contents. 
 * [<code>bx <b>cd</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nih-box/usage/cd/): Change Box working directories. 
 * [<code>bx <b>cp</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nih-box/usage/cp/): Copy files and directories to/from Box.
 * [<code>bx <b>mkdir</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nih-box/usage/mkdir/): Make a new directory on Box.
 * [<code>bx <b>rm</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nih-box/usage/rm/): Remove files or directories on Box.

**bx** is a command-line tool that make using Box easier than ever before! It leverages [Box's python-sdk](http://opensource.box.com/box-python-sdk/) to make it easy to manage your [Box@NIH](https://nih.box.com/) account. Users who are familiar with unix-like environments will love its easy to remember set of commands. 

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](https://openomics.github.io/nih-box/usage/ls/) section of each available sub command.
