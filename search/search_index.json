Its long-term goals: to enable FAIR 1 scientific research, to archive and share project data, and to create a unified tool that makes using Box easier than ever before! Overview \u00b6 Welcome to bx! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through bx's documentation . The ./bx command-line tool is composed several inter-related sub commands to explore and archive data across the NIH's Box storage system. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: bx ls : List Box directory contents. bx cd : Change Box working directories. bx cp : Copy files and directories to/from Box. bx mkdir : Make a new directory on Box. bx rm : Remove files or directories on Box. bx is a command-line tool that make using Box easier than ever before! It leverages Box's python-sdk to make it easy to manage your Box@NIH account. Users who are familiar with unix-like environments will love its easy to remember set of commands. Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the usage section of each available sub command. For more information about issues or trouble-shooting a problem, please checkout our FAQ prior to opening an issue on Github . Dependencies \u00b6 Requires: python>=3.8 At the current moment, the only dependency is python! Please install a version of python greater than or equal to 3.8 . Any missing python requirements can be installed with the requirements.txt . Contribute \u00b6 This site is a living document, created for and by members like you. bx is maintained by the members of OpenOmics and is improved by continous feedback!
